\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
\label{ack}

I would firstly, like to express my gratitude to Dr Arno Barnard. Without his guidance, considerations and patience, this project would have been impossible. I could not have asked for a better study leader.
\\\\
I would, furthermore, be remiss if I did not thank my friends. Their compassion, motivation and companionship served as a beacon of light, through the long (and often dark) nights comprising the completion of this project. Thank you Jonathan Hendricks for reminding me to stay positive despite the odds. Thank you Mohini Takoorparsadh for your inspirational work ethic and technical assistance. Thank you Andre Bezuidenhoudt, for housing me during the troubled times that 2020 ensured.
\\\\
My gratitude also extends to my bursary givers: G S Fainsinger \& Associates cc. Without the financial support provided, I would not have made it this far.
\\\\
Lastly and most importantly, my unending gratitude extends to my parents. Your unconditional support in this endeavour has resulted in its completion. Thank you for believing in me despite a long chain of failures. Thank you for reminding me that things always turn out fine in the end. Thank you for loving me incomprehensibly.
