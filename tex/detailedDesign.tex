In \textbf{\nameref{3}}, a general overview of the autonomous system (created in order to evaluate high-level code structures) was given. This chapter will expand upon the concepts and functions introduced in \textbf{\nameref{3}}. For each functional block depicted in Figure~\ref{aso} a flow diagram of the logical steps used to create the program will be included. Not all the python code forming part of the individual programs will be discussed although the code used as part of this project can be viewed in its entirety in \textbf{\nameref{C}}, \textbf{\nameref{D}} and \textbf{\nameref{E}}.
